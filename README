Welcome to meminfo.py:README.

meminfo was born out of a need to report large system memory usage in
some meaningful way. ps and top have their uses, as do others, but they
have two problems (in my opinion):
1) they don't show URES (unique resident size)
2) the information they provide is of limited value once you start having
  1000+ processes on a multi-user system
  
meminfo fills the gap (or aims to at least).

Tested on 2.6 kernels and one 2.4 system (debian 3.1)

---------------------------

generates three lists according to real memory usage:
- first is sorted by URES per process
- second one groups processes according to usernames and sorts that based on ures
- third groups based on process names and again sorts based on total ures
- fourth is optional and depends whether you have SMP-system or not
  tries to group memory and runtimes according to logical CPUs
  if you don't have SMP (enabled), you won't see the fourth report
  and the first report will be missing the C#-field (CPU that last
  executed a process).
